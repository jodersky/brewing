# 100l Challenge

## Main ideas

- Standardized containers (50gal drums), shipping container analogy.
- Produce several batches slightly shifted in time.
- Use electric heating to automate stages where the temperature must me maintained constant.

### Heating

c_p water = 4180 J * kg^-1 * C^-1
heat 40l from 20 to 100° = 4k*40*(100-20) = 25'600kJ
mean 7h10 with 1kW ! without losses (5min/°C)
typical plug => 10A => 2kW (what about wash machines's ones?)

- Probably gaz heating will be required

### Containers

- Where to find/buy them ?

### Electronics

- Purpose build controllers vs sensors + microcontroller + actuator
- SSR = solide state relay, analog switching would be best
